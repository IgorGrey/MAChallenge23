Add functionality for displaying: (either in console or as visualization)
 - speed in knots
 - heading and cross-track - numeric in meters
 - distance to waypoint in meters

Additional or as a main logic of thrust/heading change in relation to distance to waypoint (if statments):
- use gps location instead to confirm arrival to waypoint (drop few deciaml places from both lat and lon to create area of arrival to the waypoint)
